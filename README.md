## Puppet-Framework: Automation/Deployment Tools

###This is a puppet platform developed initially as a deployment tool. It is several years out of date but could be useful somewhere to someone. Basically these puppet manifests were executed against several hundred nodes. That was either with Hudson/Jenkins or with an old style puppet-run.
